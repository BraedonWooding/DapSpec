# DapSpec

Specification for the Dap Language.  Format is loosely based off the Rust reference document.

Unlike rust, this aims to be a *complete* specification of Dap itself, and not simply just a reference guide.  However, at the current moment it's a rough idea around what the language is heading towards.

More importantly, at the moment the language used is VERY informal, and in some cases even first person.  Will change eventually.

## Running

$ mdbook serve --open
